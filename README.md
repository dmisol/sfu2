# sfu2

The git is aimed to act as a **demo** for our **flexatar** technology. The SFU inherited from original ![pion](https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws) example, with server-side animating of **flexatar**.

In the context of the given demo,
 * you can create a simplified flexatar by your own
 * try any flexatar in WebRTC conference, where SFU decodes opus audio track, sends it to animating core, builds h.264 video track and uses it as if came from a user.
 * Alternatively, you can try a demo of rendering with WebGL

To try this yourself, please visit our demo at ![https://flexatar.com](https://flexatar.com).

The final goal is to offer ![in-browser WebGL rendering](https://github.com/dmisol/flexatar-virtual-webcam), introducing personalized **WebRTC Virtual Webcam**.
