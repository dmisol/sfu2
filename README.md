# sfu2

The git is aimed to act as a demo for our **flexatar** technology. The SFU inherited from original ![pion](https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws) example, with server-side animating of **flexatar**.

SFU decodes opus audio track, sends it to animating core, builds h.264 video track and uses it as if came from a user.
